. This library writes a character in annotation mode represented by the char code provided
. This library only prints characters with codes greater than or equal to 30 (control codes are absent).
. This library uses slot 0 for input.
. This library uses slots 1 and 2 for variables.

. v0 is the char code to write
N001 1
. v2 is the counter
N002 29
. check for index too low and halt if true
